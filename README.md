# My First Coding Assignment #

![](<Ed Edd and Eddy.gif>)

## About Me ##
I try not to take life seriously, but sometimes it can be a drag. 
I keep my peace of mind by watching anime, reading comics or creating content 
for social media. Today, August 22, 2023 is the start of my grad program.

## Past Coding Experience ##
Professionally, I don't have much coding experience, but I do recall the long nights 
back in primary school where I'd upgrade my MySpace profile with SpongeBob and Looney Tooney themes. 
Maybe that counts for something?

## Career Goals ## 
1. Pivot away from marketing 
2. Gain a greater understanding of development processes
3. Pitch a script/TV Show
4. Start my own business 
5. Retire early if the climate doesn't take me out first
